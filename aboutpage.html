      <p>Welcome to Lost Paws, a project dedicated to reuniting lost pets with their loving families. Our platform allow users to post about their lost pets and 
        connect them with stray animal sightings from community members, making it easier to help animals find their way home. Whether your furry friend has wandered 
        off or you've found an animal in need of help, we are here to support you in every step of the way. We believe that every pet deserves to be safe, and 
        we are here to make sure no one has to search alone. Thank you for being part of a community that cares.</p>
      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>At Lost Paws, our mission is to reunite lost pets with their families by providing a compassionate, community-driven platform. We strive to make pet 
          recovery easier through real-time alerts, verified reports, and seamless connections between pet owners and kind-hearted finders. Our goal is to ensure 
          that no lost pet goes unnoticed and that every animal has the best chance of returning home safely. Together, we can create a world where no one has to 
          search alone.</p>
